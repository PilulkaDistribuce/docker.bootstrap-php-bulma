# Docker, docker-compose, PHP and Bulma CSS

This repository is an illustrative example of implementing a docker-compose project with containers to develop frontend in node.js and backend in PHP.
We used the Bulma start package to develop the front end part.

You can build a project using docker-compose up -d, It launches a version of the application for development purposes - on the frontend, a file-watcher runs to track changes in SASS and JS files.

It compiles:
* JS files from EC6 to EC5
* SASS to CSS

Happy bootstrapping.
